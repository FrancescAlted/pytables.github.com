<a name="l-2"></a><span class="tm">20:25:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;PyTablesBot`&gt;</span> Meeting started Mon Aug 29 20:25:27 2011 UTC.  The chair is joshmoore. Information about MeetBot at http://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot.

<a name="l-5"></a><span class="tm">20:26:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> So I was thinking first we should brain storm about things we want to cover (but then again, I was thinking there would be more people)
<a name="l-6"></a><span class="tm">20:26:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">avalentino:</span> anything particular on your list?
<a name="l-7"></a><span class="tm">20:26:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> scopatz had wanted to discuss the release schedule
<a name="l-8"></a><span class="tm">20:26:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> yes, release scheule
<a name="l-9"></a><span class="tm">20:27:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> and rodmap for release &gt; 2.3
<a name="l-10"></a><span class="tm">20:27:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> agreed.
<a name="l-11"></a><span class="tm">20:27:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> There was also mailing lists.
<a name="l-12"></a><span class="tm">20:27:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> And then the question of how often we want to try to have these meetings.
<a name="l-13"></a><span class="tm">20:27:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Sound like enough (or too much) to tackle?
<a name="l-14"></a><span class="tm">20:28:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-15"></a><span class="tm">20:28:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> you get the first pick :)
<a name="l-16"></a><span class="tm">20:30:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> regarding release schedule for 2.3
<a name="l-17"></a><span class="tm">20:30:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="topic">#topic </span><span class="topicline">2.3 Release Schedule</span>
<a name="l-18"></a><span class="tm">20:31:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> IMHO we should release the firs beta as soon as possible
<a name="l-19"></a><span class="tm">20:31:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> right, at this point, you're basically just fixing bugs, right?
<a name="l-20"></a><span class="tm">20:31:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> (and warnings, etc)
<a name="l-21"></a><span class="tm">20:32:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> we only miss release doc update
<a name="l-22"></a><span class="tm">20:32:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> the rest is almost done
<a name="l-23"></a><span class="tm">20:32:38</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I saw that and wanted to ask: what all's missing?
<a name="l-24"></a><span class="tm">20:33:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> The integration of pro is ok, no?
<a name="l-25"></a><span class="tm">20:33:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> (in the docs, I mean)
<a name="l-26"></a><span class="tm">20:33:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> yes
<a name="l-27"></a><span class="tm">20:33:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> the UG needs some lifting (at reStruvturedText level)
<a name="l-28"></a><span class="tm">20:33:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> but is is OK
<a name="l-29"></a><span class="tm">20:34:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#link </span><span class="cmdline">https://github.com/PyTables/PyTables/issues/80</span>
<a name="l-30"></a><span class="tm">20:34:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> How much time do you think? Can you tell me where it's off and I can get my hands dirty? Or is it something you've almost got done?
<a name="l-31"></a><span class="tm">20:34:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> no 0%
<a name="l-32"></a><span class="tm">20:35:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> we should add all new features fron the pro version
<a name="l-33"></a><span class="tm">20:35:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> ... in the release doc
<a name="l-34"></a><span class="tm">20:35:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> ok, so we do that before the 1st beta?
<a name="l-35"></a><span class="tm">20:36:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> (so people can find the features)
<a name="l-36"></a><span class="tm">20:37:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> yes IMHO
<a name="l-37"></a><span class="tm">20:37:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> IMO, the new features are basically 2: the new OPSI engine (indexing) and enhanced caching
<a name="l-38"></a><span class="tm">20:38:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> make sense just point users to PyTables Pro page?
<a name="l-39"></a><span class="tm">20:38:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> enhanced caching is internal stuff, so no need to document a lot (perhaps some new params, tahts all)
<a name="l-40"></a><span class="tm">20:38:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Just generating the latest docs. .... where were you thinking of adding the text, avalentino? There's certainly some from faltet already, no?
<a name="l-41"></a><span class="tm">20:39:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> ?? RELEASE_NOTES.txt ?
<a name="l-42"></a><span class="tm">20:39:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> linking to the Pro page could be enough initially, I think
<a name="l-43"></a><span class="tm">20:39:50 </span><span class="nka">* joshmoore</span> <span class="ac">smacks head.</span>
<a name="l-44"></a><span class="tm">20:40:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Understood. I was thinking something was missing from the documentation for release.
<a name="l-45"></a><span class="tm">20:40:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I can take a swing at adding a summary then if that's the goal.
<a name="l-46"></a><span class="tm">20:40:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> perfect
<a name="l-47"></a><span class="tm">20:41:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> and all the indexing stuff is fully documented in the UG, so you can put some links to there too.
<a name="l-48"></a><span class="tm">20:41:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">joshmoore takes gh-80 and updates the RELEASE_NOTES.txt</span>
<a name="l-49"></a><span class="tm">20:41:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">faltet:</span> will do.
<a name="l-50"></a><span class="tm">20:42:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> ok. I'll push that tomorrow or Wednesday for review. Anything else before we push 2.3b1?
<a name="l-51"></a><span class="tm">20:42:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> one important thing: where are you going to hung the new UG?
<a name="l-52"></a><span class="tm">20:43:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I was just looking into pages.github.com
<a name="l-53"></a><span class="tm">20:43:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#link </span><span class="cmdline">https://github.com/blog/272-github-pages</span>
<a name="l-54"></a><span class="tm">20:43:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> So we could host one copy there. I don't know how easily you can work them into pytables.org, faltet.
<a name="l-55"></a><span class="tm">20:44:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> also pypi can host docs
<a name="l-56"></a><span class="tm">20:44:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> then there's http://readthedocs.org
<a name="l-57"></a><span class="tm">20:45:03</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> don't know much about it
<a name="l-58"></a><span class="tm">20:45:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/getting_started.html#import-your-docs
<a name="l-59"></a><span class="tm">20:45:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> several github/sphink projects that I've looked into recently use it.
<a name="l-60"></a><span class="tm">20:45:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> virtualenv, pip
<a name="l-61"></a><span class="tm">20:45:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> I like it
<a name="l-62"></a><span class="tm">20:45:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> pytables.org is a virtual server owned by me, but I don't think is a good idea to continue using it
<a name="l-63"></a><span class="tm">20:46:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> readthedocs does look quite nice.
<a name="l-64"></a><span class="tm">20:46:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> hosting the manual in github-pages looks good
<a name="l-65"></a><span class="tm">20:46:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">faltet:</span> understood.
<a name="l-66"></a><span class="tm">20:46:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> the github-pages would also be where I put the logs from MeetBot (if you're ok with that)
<a name="l-67"></a><span class="tm">20:47:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-68"></a><span class="tm">20:47:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> (here comes a little bit of MeetBot spam)
<a name="l-69"></a><span class="tm">20:47:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#item </span><span class="cmdline">2.3b1 as soon as possible</span>

<a name="l-71"></a><span class="tm">20:48:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> ok, I just added a new issue for that last one: https://github.com/PyTables/PyTables/issues/95
<a name="l-72"></a><span class="tm">20:49:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> What else are we going to need to do to get 2.3b1 out the door?
<a name="l-73"></a><span class="tm">20:49:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> the http://read-the-docs.readthedocs.org seems nice too
<a name="l-74"></a><span class="tm">20:50:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> I saw some tickets from antonio about Python 3 compatibility
<a name="l-75"></a><span class="tm">20:50:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I'll have to look into it some more; I think you can do both.
<a name="l-76"></a><span class="tm">20:50:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#item </span><span class="cmdline">python3 compatibility</span>
<a name="l-77"></a><span class="tm">20:50:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> do you plan to have Python 3 support for 2.3?
<a name="l-78"></a><span class="tm">20:51:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> IMHO to much work for 2.3
<a name="l-79"></a><span class="tm">20:51:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Personally I wouldn't think so.
<a name="l-80"></a><span class="tm">20:52:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> ah ok. just curious
<a name="l-81"></a><span class="tm">20:52:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> there is some preliminar step we could address in 2.3
<a name="l-82"></a><span class="tm">20:52:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I was actually going to ask about that under "What comes after 2.3?". Do we go to PyTables 3.0 for Python 3 support?
<a name="l-83"></a><span class="tm">20:53:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> IMHO 3 (we also have a lot of deprecated features now)
<a name="l-84"></a><span class="tm">20:53:44</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> Numarray, numeric, HDF5 1.6 (??), netcdf ..
<a name="l-85"></a><span class="tm">20:54:22</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> well, PyTables 3 could be a nice match for Python 3 support ;)
<a name="l-86"></a><span class="tm">20:54:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Agreed. :)
<a name="l-87"></a><span class="tm">20:54:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> And while we're doing all that, it might be necessary/beneficial to have a 2.4. We'll just have to wait and see.
<a name="l-88"></a><span class="tm">20:55:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-89"></a><span class="tm">20:55:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Ok, so assuming the notes and docs were ready by next week, would we want to do 2.3b1 then?
<a name="l-90"></a><span class="tm">20:55:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> I'd also deprecate HDF5 1.6 for PyTables 3
<a name="l-91"></a><span class="tm">20:56:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-92"></a><span class="tm">20:56:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> and what about python 2.4  and 2.5
<a name="l-93"></a><span class="tm">20:56:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> but would continue supporting it (HDF5 1.6) for 2.x series
<a name="l-94"></a><span class="tm">20:56:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I'm adding a 3.0 milestone and an issue for that, faltet.
<a name="l-95"></a><span class="tm">20:58:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> we (openmicroscopy) still have 2.4 support planned, but at some point it will end.
<a name="l-96"></a><span class="tm">20:58:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> hey scopatz!
<a name="l-97"></a><span class="tm">20:58:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Hey Everyone
<a name="l-98"></a><span class="tm">20:58:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> don't know about python 2.4 and 2.5. my suggestion would be to keep compatibility with them in 2.x series, and restrict for 2.6 (perhaps 2.7) for PyTables 3
<a name="l-99"></a><span class="tm">20:58:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Sorry I am late
<a name="l-100"></a><span class="tm">20:59:01</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> hi anthony
<a name="l-101"></a><span class="tm">20:59:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> welcome Anthony!
<a name="l-102"></a><span class="tm">20:59:15</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Hello all!
<a name="l-103"></a><span class="tm">20:59:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> SciPy still supports 2.4
<a name="l-104"></a><span class="tm">20:59:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> which I think is a mistake.
<a name="l-105"></a><span class="tm">20:59:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-106"></a><span class="tm">21:00:04</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> faltet +1 for keeping support in 2.x series
<a name="l-107"></a><span class="tm">21:00:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> so probably we also need a 2.4
<a name="l-108"></a><span class="tm">21:00:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> probably a lot of scientists would think like this
<a name="l-109"></a><span class="tm">21:00:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> *would not*
<a name="l-110"></a><span class="tm">21:01:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> IMO, keeping Python 2.4 compatibility in PyTables 2.x series would be nice for users
<a name="l-111"></a><span class="tm">21:02:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Hmm the advantages to moving to 2.6-2.7 are really high, though.
<a name="l-112"></a><span class="tm">21:02:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">scopatz:</span> I just sent you the IRC log.
<a name="l-113"></a><span class="tm">21:02:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> (thanks)
<a name="l-114"></a><span class="tm">21:02:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> (np)
<a name="l-115"></a><span class="tm">21:02:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> more advanced development can take place in PyTables 3.x branches
<a name="l-116"></a><span class="tm">21:02:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">scopatz:</span> can you outline the advantages?
<a name="l-117"></a><span class="tm">21:02:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#item </span><span class="cmdline">py24 / py25 support</span>
<a name="l-118"></a><span class="tm">21:03:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> with statement, new style formatting, set and dictionary comprehensions, argparse
<a name="l-119"></a><span class="tm">21:03:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> New AST module
<a name="l-120"></a><span class="tm">21:04:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> These are probably the main ones that I use daily.
<a name="l-121"></a><span class="tm">21:04:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> argparse we could ship (openmicroscopy does)
<a name="l-122"></a><span class="tm">21:04:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> and PyTables 2.x series would remain mainly for maintenance (perhaps receiving some improvements from 3.x)
<a name="l-123"></a><span class="tm">21:05:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> in a way, this isn't much of a release other than being Pro. (barring the documentation beautification which is great!)
<a name="l-124"></a><span class="tm">21:05:19</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> but manitaining both 2.x and 3.x branches is much more work, of course...
<a name="l-125"></a><span class="tm">21:05:21</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> faltet, If that is the case, then yeah I see no problem with supporting old version
<a name="l-126"></a><span class="tm">21:05:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> So, it would certainly seem a bit unfair to pull the python24/25 rug out from people.
<a name="l-127"></a><span class="tm">21:06:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Yeah...
<a name="l-128"></a><span class="tm">21:06:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> it basically depends on you, the new maintainers
<a name="l-129"></a><span class="tm">21:06:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> I think you have me convinced.
<a name="l-130"></a><span class="tm">21:07:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> so jumping back a question or two: when do we want to shoot for 2.3b1?
<a name="l-131"></a><span class="tm">21:07:52</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">(scopatz:</span> in case you haven't finished skimming the log, that essentially means getting release notes ready and the documentation up somewhere)
<a name="l-132"></a><span class="tm">21:08:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> (thanks)
<a name="l-133"></a><span class="tm">21:09:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Would sometime in the next week or two be reasonable?
<a name="l-134"></a><span class="tm">21:09:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> that was my idea
<a name="l-135"></a><span class="tm">21:10:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I think so. I'll do the doc dance before travelling this weekend. If you guys can handle any of the other loose ends, then we should be good.
<a name="l-136"></a><span class="tm">21:10:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> faltet, how much longer will pytables.org be available?
<a name="l-137"></a><span class="tm">21:10:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> 8 months aprox
<a name="l-138"></a><span class="tm">21:11:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> OK, it would be nice to migrate some of the misc docs on the website to the sphinx docs too (FAQ, etc.)
<a name="l-139"></a><span class="tm">21:11:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Should be pretty easy.
<a name="l-140"></a><span class="tm">21:11:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">(faltet:</span> Ok thanks)
<a name="l-141"></a><span class="tm">21:11:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> for 2.3?
<a name="l-142"></a><span class="tm">21:12:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Maybe, it could wait too.  it isn't 2.3 critical
<a name="l-143"></a><span class="tm">21:12:26</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> agreed
<a name="l-144"></a><span class="tm">21:12:39</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> That is basically if we want to drive our entire webpresense from the sphinx docs.
<a name="l-145"></a><span class="tm">21:13:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">scopatz:</span> which could make sense? I've noted it down for a later meeting.
<a name="l-146"></a><span class="tm">21:13:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> So maybe we should shoot for a 2.3 release Thursday of next week?
<a name="l-147"></a><span class="tm">21:13:24</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> then that mostly leaves testing for 2.3, eh? didn't anyone get to look at the CI builds?

<a name="l-149"></a><span class="tm">21:13:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> I don't know for 2.3, but for future release, I'd merge some of the blurb in pytables.org/moin/PyTablesPro in the Introduction chapter of UG. that should be easy
<a name="l-150"></a><span class="tm">21:14:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">faltet:</span> definitely.
<a name="l-151"></a><span class="tm">21:14:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> ah man! That's what I was going to take for the release notes. ;)
<a name="l-152"></a><span class="tm">21:14:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> haha you still can ;)
<a name="l-153"></a><span class="tm">21:15:48</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> I am still getting used to jenkins.  it seems like it is building OK though.

<a name="l-159"></a><span class="tm">21:17:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> we'll strike that from the record ;)
<a name="l-160"></a><span class="tm">21:17:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> I meant that having a new release of PyTables soon would be nice for our next Python school in the middle of September
<a name="l-161"></a><span class="tm">21:18:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Then let's do it!
<a name="l-162"></a><span class="tm">21:18:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> so is there anything else in the way of testing we need/want?
<a name="l-163"></a><span class="tm">21:18:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">scopatz:</span> do you want notifications from the jenkins builds?

<a name="l-167"></a><span class="tm">21:20:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I just kicked off a heavy build. We'll see how that looks in the morning.
<a name="l-168"></a><span class="tm">21:20:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> josh, do you think that the testing platform could cope with heavy tests?
<a name="l-169"></a><span class="tm">21:20:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> I'd relax that and just run the light suite
<a name="l-170"></a><span class="tm">21:20:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> what do *you* think?
<a name="l-171"></a><span class="tm">21:21:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Ok.....*grabs a bucket of water*
<a name="l-172"></a><span class="tm">21:21:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> in my experience, the heavy suite should be run once or twice before a release, not more
<a name="l-173"></a><span class="tm">21:21:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-174"></a><span class="tm">21:21:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Ok. So we do that next week.
<a name="l-175"></a><span class="tm">21:22:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> 3 hours running tests is quite a lot. 5 minutes is handier, IMO
<a name="l-176"></a><span class="tm">21:22:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="cmd">#action </span><span class="cmdline">run heavy tests before 2.3b1</span>
<a name="l-177"></a><span class="tm">21:22:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> another thing: you insist with 2.3b1. I suggest 2.3rc1
<a name="l-178"></a><span class="tm">21:23:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> heh. We have on the order of dozen machines for testing, so it's certainly manageable once a day.
<a name="l-179"></a><span class="tm">21:23:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Ah, better.
<a name="l-180"></a><span class="tm">21:23:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> 2.3b1 is habit.
<a name="l-181"></a><span class="tm">21:23:25</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I'd vote for that.
<a name="l-182"></a><span class="tm">21:23:40</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> all?
<a name="l-183"></a><span class="tm">21:23:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> <span class="hi">rational:</span> 2.3 is basically 2.2.1pro, which was completely stable
<a name="l-184"></a><span class="tm">21:23:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> but there is not new functionality to test
<a name="l-185"></a><span class="tm">21:24:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> yes, I agree.
<a name="l-186"></a><span class="tm">21:24:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> just documentation changes to proof read. :)
<a name="l-187"></a><span class="tm">21:24:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> and a couple of bugfixes
<a name="l-188"></a><span class="tm">21:24:31</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> but it is your first release, so I understand thta you want to be on the safe side
<a name="l-189"></a><span class="tm">21:24:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> no, I'm always like this. *lol*
<a name="l-190"></a><span class="tm">21:25:02</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> who long is the rc period?

<a name="l-193"></a><span class="tm">21:25:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> for me, rc1 would take a week, and a rc2 another week. final would come a week before...
<a name="l-194"></a><span class="tm">21:25:51</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> It varies widely.  I would be fine with a week
<a name="l-195"></a><span class="tm">21:26:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> rc code have to be considered completely frozen?
<a name="l-196"></a><span class="tm">21:26:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> three weeks for final in total after rc1 release
<a name="l-197"></a><span class="tm">21:27:43</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Antonio, no the point of the rc is for people to hammer on it and find any critical bugs that need to be changed before the final
<a name="l-198"></a><span class="tm">21:27:49</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> yes, completely fron, except for fixing bugs, of course :)
<a name="l-199"></a><span class="tm">21:28:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> *frozen*
<a name="l-200"></a><span class="tm">21:28:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> OK
<a name="l-201"></a><span class="tm">21:28:30</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> freature freeze, not code freeze ;)
<a name="l-202"></a><span class="tm">21:28:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> exactly :)
<a name="l-203"></a><span class="tm">21:29:09</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> *feature
<a name="l-204"></a><span class="tm">21:29:42</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> well I was thinking to improve py3k compatibility a little more for 2.3
<a name="l-205"></a><span class="tm">21:30:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> bot maybe it is not the a goo idea at this point
<a name="l-206"></a><span class="tm">21:30:06</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> *but*
<a name="l-207"></a><span class="tm">21:30:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> well, improving Py3 this is a feature, clearly...
<a name="l-208"></a><span class="tm">21:31:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> I'd concur. More code changes means I'll get nervous again. And none of us wants that, do we?
<a name="l-209"></a><span class="tm">21:31:37</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> OK :)
<a name="l-210"></a><span class="tm">21:31:47</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Yeah it could probably wait until after the release.  Of course, you could always work on it in your own fork or branch and just wait to merge it back into master.
<a name="l-211"></a><span class="tm">21:32:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> IMO, I'd create a new branch for improving py3k compatibility, that will eventaully become PyTables 3.x...
<a name="l-212"></a><span class="tm">21:33:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">avalentino:</span> there's a py3k milestone, so let's add a few branches and run with it.
<a name="l-213"></a><span class="tm">21:33:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Ok. 2.3rc1 to go out next week which is very cool, py3k in a branch which is also cool. We're at a bit over an hour. Can I suggest we handle some of the less exciting things?
<a name="l-214"></a><span class="tm">21:34:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> ok
<a name="l-215"></a><span class="tm">21:34:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Go for it.

<a name="l-217"></a><span class="tm">21:34:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-218"></a><span class="tm">21:35:14</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Assuming, we don't have these meetings too often, we're going to probably have some channel of communication.
<a name="l-219"></a><span class="tm">21:35:17</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> (for governance)
<a name="l-220"></a><span class="tm">21:35:27</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> There was also the suggestion of moving pytables-users to google groups.
<a name="l-221"></a><span class="tm">21:35:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> We don't have to deal with that right now, but if we're adding a new list, might make sense to pick where we want to eventually end up.
<a name="l-222"></a><span class="tm">21:36:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Alternatively, we can discuss things vit github and periodically do IRC. Just setting up this meeting was a bit of a rollercoaster. If we could make it easier (and transparent to the community) that'd be really great.
<a name="l-223"></a><span class="tm">21:36:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> We could have a users list as well as a dev list
<a name="l-224"></a><span class="tm">21:37:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> +1
<a name="l-225"></a><span class="tm">21:38:23</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> before there was not much point in having a dev list, but with three developers now, it makes a lot of sense
<a name="l-226"></a><span class="tm">21:38:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> the dev list should be public though as well.
<a name="l-227"></a><span class="tm">21:38:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> I think we want as many devs as possible ;)
<a name="l-228"></a><span class="tm">21:38:57</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> <span class="hi">scopatz:</span> agree completely. the more people the better.
<a name="l-229"></a><span class="tm">21:39:05</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> of curse
<a name="l-230"></a><span class="tm">21:39:18</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> more true than you intended, avalentino!
<a name="l-231"></a><span class="tm">21:39:29</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> sure
<a name="l-232"></a><span class="tm">21:39:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-233"></a><span class="tm">21:39:45</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> ok. are we going for google-groups then?
<a name="l-234"></a><span class="tm">21:39:50</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> are there any other outstanding choices?
<a name="l-235"></a><span class="tm">21:40:10</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> I am fine with googlegroups, if only because it is easy and not sourceforge
<a name="l-236"></a><span class="tm">21:40:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> and has google visibility, which is *important*
<a name="l-237"></a><span class="tm">21:40:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> googlegroups is OK
<a name="l-238"></a><span class="tm">21:41:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> ok, that sounds like a decision. Creating pytables-dev now....

<a name="l-240"></a><span class="tm">21:41:32</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Simiarly, when do we want the next meeting? how often?
<a name="l-241"></a><span class="tm">21:41:36</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Only when needed?
<a name="l-242"></a><span class="tm">21:41:56</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> well probably whenever we want to do releases.
<a name="l-243"></a><span class="tm">21:42:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> I am in favor of a regular release schedule
<a name="l-244"></a><span class="tm">21:42:16</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> once every 3-6 months.
<a name="l-245"></a><span class="tm">21:42:35</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> 3, 4, or 6 are really the only ones that make sense
<a name="l-246"></a><span class="tm">21:43:46</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> why regular releases?
<a name="l-247"></a><span class="tm">21:44:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> It motivates developers to fix bugs, update docs, etc if they know that there is a release coming
<a name="l-248"></a><span class="tm">21:45:11</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Maybe that is not needed as much with mature packages like PyTables.
<a name="l-249"></a><span class="tm">21:46:28</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> maybe we could set a target release date for PyTables 2.3 + 1
<a name="l-250"></a><span class="tm">21:46:33</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> I would be willing to play this by ear, but we should probably meet at least once per release.
<a name="l-251"></a><span class="tm">21:46:41</span><span class="nk"> &lt;avalentino&gt;</span> and then fix the release period
<a name="l-252"></a><span class="tm">21:47:08</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> That works for me.  I don't think this has to be decided now.
<a name="l-253"></a><span class="tm">21:47:55</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Like I said earlier, I'm in a chat room all day with my dev team and we have 3 conference calls per week, so I'm really fine with almost any frequency of meeting that you guys are comfortable with.
<a name="l-254"></a><span class="tm">21:48:00</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-255"></a><span class="tm">21:48:54</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> ok then, so it seems you are in agreement :)
<a name="l-256"></a><span class="tm">21:48:59</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> Haha I am not up for that much! ;)
<a name="l-257"></a><span class="tm">21:49:12</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> :)
<a name="l-258"></a><span class="tm">21:49:13</span><span class="nk"> &lt;scopatz&gt;</span> <span class="hi">faltet:</span> Yeah, I think so
<a name="l-259"></a><span class="tm">21:49:34</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> nice to see that we will have a 2.3 release anytime soon
<a name="l-260"></a><span class="tm">21:49:58</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> Hmmmm....ok. Then I'll take it upon me to bother everyone at some point for a next meeting (it'll be easier with the dev list).
<a name="l-261"></a><span class="tm">21:50:07</span><span class="nk"> &lt;faltet&gt;</span> that will make me (and my pupils!) more confident for my next course
<a name="l-262"></a><span class="tm">21:50:20</span><span class="nk"> &lt;joshmoore&gt;</span> here, here.
